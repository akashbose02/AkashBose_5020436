STEP 4: ANALYSIS

Time Complexity Comparison

1. Linear Search:

   - Best Case: O(1) 
     - This occurs when the target element is the first element in the list.
   - Average Case: O(n)
     - On average, you may need to check half of the elements in the list to find the target.
   - Worst Case:O(n) 
     - This occurs when the target element is not present in the list or is the last element.

2. Binary Search:

   - Best Case: O(1) 
     - This occurs when the target element is exactly in the middle of the list.
   - Average Case: O(log n) 
     - The list is divided in half at each step, so the time complexity grows 
     logarithmically with the number of elements.
   - Worst Case: O(log n) 
     - This occurs when the target element is not present, requiring the algorithm to
      reduce the search interval until it is empty.

WHEN TO USE EACH ALGORITHM

1. Linear Search:

   Use Cases:
     - Unsorted Lists: Linear search works regardless of whether the list is sorted or not.
     - Small Data Sets: For small lists, the difference in efficiency between linear and binary search is negligible.
     - Simple Implementation: If you need a quick and simple solution without additional requirements.

   Advantages:
     - Simple to implement.
     - No requirement for the list to be sorted.

   Disadvantages:
     - Inefficient for large lists due to its linear time complexity.

2. Binary Search:

   Use Cases:
     - Sorted Lists: Binary search requires that the list be sorted. If the list is sorted 
        or if you can afford to sort it beforehand, binary search is preferable.
     - Large Data Sets: For large lists, binary search is much more efficient due to its logarithmic time complexity.
     - Performance-Critical Applications: When searching through large volumes of data where efficiency is crucial.

   Advantages:
     - Much faster than linear search for large data sets.
     - Efficient for sorted data due to its logarithmic time complexity.

   Disadvantages:
     - Requires the data to be sorted.
     - More complex to implement compared to linear search.
