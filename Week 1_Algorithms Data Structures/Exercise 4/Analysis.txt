STEP 5. ANALYSIS

1.Time Complexity of Operations:

A. Add Operation:
Time Complexity: O(1) (Constant time since we add the employee to the end of the array if space is available)

B.Search Operation:
Time Complexity: O(n) (Linear time, as we may need to scan through the entire array to find the employee)

C.Traverse Operation:
Time Complexity: O(n) (Linear time, as we need to visit each element in the array)

D.Delete Operation:
Time Complexity: O(n) (Linear time, as we may need to shift elements after deleting an employee)

2. WHEN TO USE ARRAYS: Arrays are suitable when:

a. The number of elements is known and fixed.
b. Fast random access to elements is required.
c. Memory usage needs to be minimized.
