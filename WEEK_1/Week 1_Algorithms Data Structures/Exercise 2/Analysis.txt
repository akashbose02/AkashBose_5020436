STEP 4: ANALYSIS

Time Complexity Comparison:

1.Linear Search:

-Best Case: O(1)
-Average Case: O(n)
-Worst Case: O(n)

2.Binary Search:

-Best Case: O(1)
-Average Case: O(log n)
-Worst Case: O(log n)

Suitability for the Platform:

Binary Search is more suitable for the
e-commerce platform if the product data can be kept sorted or if sorting is feasible, as it provides faster search times (O(log n)) compared to linear search (O(n)).
Linear Search may be used if the dataset is small or unsorted, but it becomes inefficient for larger datasets compared to binary search.
