STEP 4: ANALYSIS .

Time Complexity of Operations:

1. Add: O(1) — Inserting an element into a HashMap has an average time complexity of O(1).
2. Update: O(1) — Updating an element in a HashMap also has an average time complexity of O(1).
3. Delete: O(1) — Removing an element from a HashMap has an average time complexity of O(1).

Optimization Considerations:

1. Data Structure Choice: Using a HashMap ensures efficient access,
 but if memory usage is a concern, consider alternative data structures like 
TreeMap for sorted order or LinkedHashMap for order preservation.
2. Concurrency: For concurrent access, consider using ConcurrentHashMap to handle multiple threads.
3.Data Size: For very large inventories, consider database solutions or specialized data storage systems.
