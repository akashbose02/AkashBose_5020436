STEP 4: ANALYSIS

1. Time Complexity: 

O(n), where n is the number of years. Each recursive call reduces the number of years by 1, 
resulting in n recursive calls.

2. Optimizing the Recursive Solution
To avoid excessive computation and stack overflow issues with deep recursion, 
we can optimize the solution using memoization or convert it to an iterative approach.

3. Memoization
Memoization involves storing the results of expensive function calls and
reusing the results when the same inputs occur again. This approach is particularly useful for problems 
with overlapping subproblems.
