STEP 1: Understanding Recursive Algorithms

1. Concept of Recursion: Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. 
This approach can simplify problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, 
which can then be solved individually.

2. Key Components of Recursion

A.Base Case: The condition under which the recursion stops. It prevents the function from calling itself indefinitely, 
which would result in a stack overflow error.
Example: In a factorial calculation, the base case is when 
n=0 or n=1.

B.Recursive Case:
The part of the function where it calls itself with modified arguments, moving towards the base case.

3. Benefits of Recursion

A. Simplifies Complex Problems:Recursion can make code more elegant and easier to understand, 
especially for problems that have a natural recursive structure, such as tree traversal, 
Fibonacci sequence calculation, and many more.
B. Reduces Code Length: Recursive solutions often have fewer lines of code compared to their iterative counterparts.

4. Drawbacks of Recursion

A.Memory Usage: Recursion can be memory-intensive as each function call adds a new frame to the call stack. 
For very deep recursions, this can lead to a stack overflow.
B. Performance: Recursive solutions can be slower than iterative solutions due to the overhead of 
repeated function calls and return operations.
